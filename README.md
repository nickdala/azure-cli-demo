# Azure CLI Demo

This project demonstrates how you can use the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) to deploy a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application to [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
